            <h3><span>Chronectomy</span></h3>
            <h5><span>Published in <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU Winter 2012</a></span></h5>
          </div>
          <div class="story">
            <p>If anyone asked why he applied for the job at the chronectomy clinic, he would give two reasons.</p>

            <p>The first: he was out of cash, which he needed after his camera got completely busted by a too-daring rooftop angle of the university at night. Second: chronectomy seemed cool, and he was intrigued by the idea of having to shoulder and step over belligerent protestors just to get in to work.</p>

            <p>There was a third reason (which he could hardly admit to himself, much less anyone else) and it was this: he was out of ideas. Despite banging his head against the wall for the past month, hoping that something, anything, would come out, all he managed was a bruised ego. The attempted rooftop angle was evidence of the lows he had sunk to: one glance at its beauty would have distracted from the lack of substance that he had to give any of his work. He probably deserved to have his camera go crashing to the bricks below.</p>

            <p>Chronectomy Lab Assistant stood out in the wanted ads, and the pay would get him a camera before the festival, so he applied. When he came in to interview he considered what answers would actually get him the job and explained that he needed bragging material for grad school applications. No, he was not pre-med, but pre-neotech. They were the right answers, because they practically shoved him into a white coat right there.</p>

            <p>It was an unnerving job at first. He watched people force their way into the clinic burdened with thoughts that they left without. In between clients he mused. Had he given up some of his own time here in the past, and forgotten about it? How would he ever know? One day he checked the files for his name and, when he didn’t find it, felt disappointed. It would have been interesting if he had found a piece of his lifetime here. Maybe interesting enough to make a story out of.</p>

            <p>Within the month, due to some student loophole, he was a certified chronectomist. Somehow he expected the whole process to be harder, especially given the vehement and omnipresent protesters and their flapping “All of life is a gift!” signs.</p>

            <p>“It’s been alright,” he explained to this parents with a shrug when they asked how the clinic job was going.</p>

            <p>“And that’s it?”</p>

            <p>“Yeah. It’s nothing impressive.”</p>

            <p>He said the same thing when his neighbor called him some days later.</p>

            <p>“Really? I thought a clinic job like that would be pretty interesting.” She hesitated on the line. “Um, what happened to the festival though? If you’re working, will you still have time to make anything?”</p>

            <p>“Well, I can’t make anything if I can’t buy a new camera, can I?”</p>

            <p>He also couldn’t make a film without a story to tell, but he couldn't say it, couldn't confess that he had once entertained the idea of pouring his soul into a film and realized it would be nothing but a white screen with buzzing silence.</p>

            <p>“Yeah...that makes sense.” She hesitated. And then: “Well, if you have any free time, let me know. Maybe we can hang out.”</p>

            <p>There she went again. “Sorry,” he told her. “They’ve got me all around the clock, and I really need to focus on this story.”</p>

            <p>He didn’t have time for her. He hardly had time for himself. The days were rushing past faster than he could grasp them, shoving him closer and closer to the festival deadline. He mulled over everything he saw and took it in to himself, trying to use it to inspire him, but everything just seemed to fall into a desperate, widening hollow in his chest.</p>

            <p>When it got too bad, he looked away and focused on work. When there weren’t extractions to prep or perform, there was always organizing to be done in the storage rooms, which were filled with shelves crammed foot to ceiling with glass vials. This was all time was, in the end — something whose footprint on human life could be captured, and stored in a vial with a novelty hourglass shape.</p>

            <p>The first time he had seen the vials he had held them in awe, and thought, There has to be a story here. Maybe in this one — an old man’s recollection of his refugee youth, marked for delivery to a museum. Maybe in this one — a witness testimony, marked for shipment to the courthouse (he shook it, thinking, Is there a murder in here? Maybe a murder mystery?).</p>

            <p>Sometimes he assisted the full-timers at local hospitals, emptying people of their lifetimes before the years were stolen by death or disease. He transposed afternoons of reading and gardening and sewing onto the minds of veterans, where the donated days of monotony smoothed away the sharp and ragged edges of their nightmares. It amused him to think it was now true that time heals all wounds. It didn’t amuse him enough to make a story about it.</p>

            <p>He kept the job to himself lest his friends think he’d given up on filmmaking — or worse, guess the hollow truth of him — but sooner or later the word got out, and a friend of a friend approached him with a vial, and asked him to transpose it.</p>

            <p>"Onto who?" Liu asked in confusion.</p>

            <p>"To me," he replied, “obviously.” Bewildered, Liu met him later and performed the transposing with a cloth mask taken from work. Later Liu learned that the extraction was black market stuff, nights of studying bottled up and inhaled in an instant, a method too good to be legal but too new to be in the rulebooks. Soon students were contacting him in droves and he couldn’t imagine where all this studying was coming from until one of his parents muttered darkly about new factories in China that exported knowledge the impoverished made and never kept, and Liu turned everyone away.</p>

            <p>The film festival drew closer. He worked harder, picking up so many extra hours that the protesters started to recognize him.</p>

            <p>“Don’t do this,” one said every time Liu put his hand on the door.</p>

            <p>“Why not?” Liu asked finally, turning to him. “It doesn’t hurt anyone. It doesn’t literally take away from anyone’s lifespan.”</p>

            <p>“But they’re not really living, are they?” The man’s face reddened. “Every moment of this life is a blessing. Even the hard times make you who you are today.”</p>

            <p>“So,” Liu said, “even this moment, this conversation I’m having with you, is something that will make me a better person?”</p>

            <p>“Not better,” the man told him, “but more you,” and Liu gave up and walked inside.</p>

            <p>More him indeed. As if simply being himself could get him the story that he wanted.</p>

            <p>He ignored the protesters from then on, and focused on work. His parents and the clinic full-timers praised his efforts, which he accepted with the best smile he could make.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>One morning, Liu came in so morose that one of the full-timers asked him what was wrong, to which Liu said something about being tired. The truth was that he had finally had earned enough money for a camera, but it was two weeks before the festival deadline — too little time to film, edit, and execute on his nonexistent ideas.</p>

            <p>He stared at the desk. Maybe he would never get any ideas. He could stay at the clinic. He could make himself forget he had ever wanted to tell stories. Maybe his future self would find the vial and shake it and wonder if he had ever killed anyone.</p>

            <p>Could that be a story? ...No.</p>

            <p>It was well into summer and the first patient of the day was late. He watched the door and eventually saw her, a girl who rushed through the protestors and their flapping signs with a bowed head. The door opened — "All of life is a gift! Don’t give away what makes you human!” — and she came inside, panting. Liu walked up to meet her. </p>

            <p>"Are you Alice?" he asked, and she nodded. Her face was wet, not from tears, he realized, but sweat. Despite the heat, she was wearing a sweater and scarf, and her clothing was damp underneath the duffel bag she was carrying.</p>

            <p>"Sorry that I’m late. I do have the waiver and stuff filled out already," she said, and pulled her bag around to fumble for the forms.</p>

            <p>"I’ll help you out back here," he interrupted, and glanced over her papers as he guided her to the counter, away from the protesters’ glares. She had checked the box that waived the extraction fee in return for donation of whatever she gave up. This was standard for someone who wanted to get rid of time they’d spent poorly: in mourning, or shame, or embarrassment.</p>

            <p>Alice was quiet as he led her to a back room, which was not unusual, but when she peered into the room and saw the divan, she recoiled.</p>

            <p>"Don’t worry," he told her, mustering cheerfulness, "I’m not a therapist," and she calmed, a bit. She set the duffel bag down with a clank.</p>

            <p>"Just get seated while I set up. You should be out of here in fifteen minutes, max."</p>

            <p>"Have you done this before?" she asked, rubbing her arms.</p>

            <p>"Yup. I’m certified and everything." While she arranged herself on the divan, he unwrapped a cloth mask and had her put it on.</p>

            <p>"It’s a little tight," she said, voice muffled.</p>

            <p>"It should be. It’ll keep the anesthetic close to your nose." He put on his own mask, made of more impermeable rubber, and started to fiddle with the aluminum caps of the two vials he had, one full, one empty.</p>

            <p>"Will it hurt?"</p>

            <p>"Nope," he answered, and then added his usual quip, "but if it did, you wouldn't remember it."</p>

            <p>Next, the most popular question: "Will I age? Physically?"</p>

            <p>"Nope. If anything, you’ll technically get a little younger. At the end, you’ll have lived a little less."</p>

            <p>"And what if you take time I didn’t want to give you?"</p>

            <p>"Not possible. Ready to find out why?"</p>

            <p>She swallowed, then nodded and closed her eyes. He opened one of the vials. Attached to the lid was an eye dropper, and he filled it and pinched it over her mask, saturating the cloth. The fumes were strong and despite precautions he got a whiff of it. It smelled like the popcorn odor that permeated the velvet theater walls...like the dust of his parents’ old, abandoned darkroom...like the peculiar raw plastic odor of his first camera. </p>

            <p>But to her it smelled different, and because she wasn’t used to it she gasped and squirmed with shock — before becoming calm and piscine, eyes glassy and mouth sucking deep breaths. He stuck the needle at the edge of her numb brow, where it connected with rubber tubing to the empty vial. He arranged a pen and clipboard stocked with yellow lined paper onto her lap.</p>

            <p>“I’m going to show you the things that you brought,” he told her. “Answer my questions about them, and write what you’re saying. Got it?”</p>

            <p>“Yeah,” she responded, lightning fast. The serum had sharpened her focus like a knife.</p>

            <p>“Good.” He began to rummage around in the duffel bag. It was completely full of stuff and with some bewilderment he lifted up a spatula and showed it to her.</p>

            <p>“What does this make you think of?” he asked her. Her pupils dilated. She spoke so fast she stumbled over the words, and her hand twitched over the paper.</p>

            <p>“Pasta — not even the fancy kind — the kind he makes for me, half red sauce, half white, sausages, peppers, ribbon-shaped noodles, on Wednesdays, after class, brought for leftovers the next day — they heat bad in the microwave but smell so so so good —”</p>

            <p>Though she was scribbling nonsense, it was doing the trick; her neurons were firing fast and easy and so strong they were burning out when she concentrated on the words to write. The tubing trembled as liquid filled it, each moment a drop of silver. Plick, plick.</p>

            <p>“It was the only thing he could make but it was awesome, better than at the fancy restaurants, and he made it whenever I wanted —”</p>

            <p>She went on, and on, and Liu watched in disbelief as the clock ticked off five minutes of spaghetti gushing. When she started to wind down, a tear squeezed out of her wide-open eyes, and he dabbed at it with his sleeve and reached hurriedly for the next item on the pile — a weathered faux-leather jacket — and lifted it up.</p>

            <p>"What does this remind you of?” he repeated.</p>

            <p>“That’s his jacket,” she told him, tears dropping into her mouth. “He gave it to me at the party where we met, I was cold, it still smells like him, when we held hands it was always in the left pocket, because the right one has a hole —"</p>

            <p>Five minutes this time.</p>

            <p>"And...this?" He fumbled to pull out the next piece of clothing from the duffel and also to wipe at her tears. His sleeve caught in the corner of her faint smile.</p>

            <p>"I wore that for our first anniversary, it’s his favorite —"</p>

            <p>Ten minutes.</p>

            <p>"And this?"</p>

            <p>She was really choking up now. "That’s the tin of the first gift he gave me, chocolates, my favorite kind, salt and caramel, though I started liking coconut when I met him —"</p>

            <p>Her memory was flawless and she regaled him with every instant she and “he” had invested in these items. Bit by bit the objects unraveled her. Their collection of plastic frozen yogurt spoons. Chopstick wrappers from every Asian place they’d been to. Movie ticket stubs. A photo of a street that he passed every time he went out of his way to pick her up after work, which she could no longer pass herself without drowning in memories. The times she’d had were like a cyst in her brain and half an hour later he was still draining it, having managed somehow to connect the tubing to more empty vials without breaking her rhythm.</p>

            <p>Maybe her boyfriend had died? It seemed sad, to relinquish her time with him just because she couldn’t cope, but who was he to judge? He dutifully showed her the items until the bag was empty, and then showed her the bag, which they had joked about filling up together to accompany them on travels across Europe. </p>

            <p>When the questions ceased, she shook her head like she was shaking a carton of milk, trying to get the last drops out. He slipped the needle out and taped a bandage over the puncture. Once her loose fingers released the pen, he took it, the clipboard, and their masks, and discarded them before opening a window to let the fumes dissipate.</p>

            <p>“Take some deep breaths,” he advised, and she did. Her eyes became lucid. After a while he asked, “Do you remember why you’re here?”</p>

            <p>“...Yeah. I didn’t want to be stuck anymore. In the past.” She said it as if she were recalling something someone else had told her. Her face pinched with thought as she came to terms with what had happened, with the existence of another self of hers, a stranger identity who had wanted to come here. She looked at upended duffel bag with furrowed brows.</p>

            <p>“That’s all the stuff I brought in, huh?”</p>

            <p>“Yes. Recognize them?”</p>

            <p>“No,” she said, “I don’t.” It was normal to be uncertain and he expected her to ask him suspiciously if he had really taken her memories, or if she had just been scammed.</p>

            <p>But instead she looked down and pulled back her sleeve to the elbow, revealing her skin, which was marked with fist-sized, blue-purple bruises. Liu started in shock — was this some new side effect? — and Alice frowned and said, with surprising calmness, “Well, I guess there’s no hiding this from you know, since I’m sure it’s part of the reason why I’m here. That asshole,” she spat.</p>

            <p>Liu stared in disbelief. “Are...are you okay?” he managed finally.</p>

            <p>“Yeah,” she decided. “I’m...just surprised...that I’m here, you know? I never thought I’d want to get rid of a bad memory. And I guess I still have most of them...” She rubbed her arms. “But he must have done something really awful that I couldn’t live with after all.”</p>

            <p>She gazed at the duffel bag. “Well, maybe now I can move on for good.”</p>

            <p>Liu realized his hands were trembling. He ushered her as calmly as he could out of the clinic, watching as she shoved and cursed her way past the protesters. He hurried back to the room, looking at the vials she’d filled, heart racing.</p>

            <p>There was so much. Rather than a single vial, she had filled three. It seemed impossible that someone could feel so much, be filled with so much fine-grained, jagged happiness that she would rather give it up than keep it.</p>

            <p>His stomach twisted. Had he ever felt things like that? Real things? Things that took his breath away, that left scars in him? What mark had time left on him, what else had it been than an endless progression, and him hardly different than he had been since the day he was born, except that his body had grown bigger, and there was therefore more space in it for nothing? He was like a cabinet that he stuffed with dreams of storytelling, a cabinet that he was too afraid of marring to actually put in anything that might really, horribly, beautifully disfigure it. </p>

            <p>And that was why he was hollow.</p>

            <p>He pulled on a cloth mask. It took him all of two minutes to completely inhale the vials into his being. He gasped and felt longing and pain and tears in his eyes.</p>

            <p>And then he quit and bought a camera.</p>

            <h5><span>Published in <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU Spring 2011</a></span></h5>
          </div>
          <div class="story">
            <p><em>"Kalmet is dead."</em></p>
            <p>Alma started - she looked around the weaver's room, saw nothing.  And then, again: <em>"Kalmet is dead."</em></p>
            <p>And again, and again: "<em>Kalmet is dead.  Kalmet is dead...</em>"</p>
            <p>But now Alma heard the chiming distinctive of sylphs' voices, louder than usual, broadcasting drama through the weaver's compound.  Kalmet, matriarch of Tonsor, was dead.</p>
            <p>The news was not completely unexpected, nor unwelcome.  For months now Kalmet had been growing more ill; she suffered constantly from one pain or another, and her weakening mind gave way to hideous rages and bouts of forgetfulness.  Kalmet would begin screaming at relatives and then demand who they were.</p>
            <p>It was Alma's hope that Kalmet's dulling brain would have forgotten Alma's person completely, but alas: Alma was preserved in Kalmet's memory in whole, probably because Alma was the only one of her grandchildren who had been born with non-standard hair, which was an eighth thinner than standard, and colored low-medium piebald, rather than high-fine white.  It was fine hair to weave into thread, perhaps, even for clothing - but it wasn't thick enough, not easily-dyed enough for Tonsor industry rope.  And certainly not for Tonsor's prized product: sails which could catch even the slightest breeze to muscle ships through high waves.</p>
            <p>The majority of the clan's money came through those sails, which meant it came through Kalmet, as she was the only one who knew how to weave them.  Without her, the clan would starve.</p>
            <p>At an administrator's suggestion, Kalmet had attempted, unsuccessfully, to train successors.  Even Alma had tried, but she, like the others, was screamed away.  <em>"Didn't I say to move the right over the left?  Can't you tell one side from the other?  Get out, you useless girl!  Get out!"</em></p>
            <p>Useless.  Alma swallowed.  She hated Kalmet, but had really tried learning sail-weaving.  When the flaw of her hair was discovered, she had been tested rigorously for anything else she could offer the clan: intelligence, spell-talent, anything.  Eventually she became a weaver, but was not much good at it.</p>
            <p>"Kalmet is dead!"</p>
            <p>If it was true, good riddance.  Alma looked down at her table. There was a weaving there, half-finished.  She stared at it, eyes narrowed.  The sylphs had distracted her.  What had she been doing, again?  Her stomach growled.  Maybe she should get food.  But she was so behind...</p>
            <p><em>Useless.</em></p>
            <p>Alma began to re-arrange the strands of hair, which were thick and glossy with strengthening spells.  As she did, she spotted a thin string with a cross-hatched pattern of white and green - one of Kalmet's many medications.  A string tied around a finger quelled Kalmet's forgetfulness.</p>
            <p>But she often discarded them in fits.  Alma sighed and carefully extricated it from beneath the hair, examining it.  As if Kalmet would care that something like this could contaminate clan products.</p>
            <p><em>"Kalmet is dead!"</em></p>
            <p>"Alma?"</p>
            <p>A real voice, this time.  "Saumaca!" Alma started, standing with a smile, then paused.  Her favorite cousin was in the doorway, but not alone.  He was flanked by two figures, one tall, with his hair wrapped in a protective veil: Bourlev, whose high-fine white supported him in his schemes, many of which somehow involved cutting Alma's hair off as she slept. She had once complained to Administrator Proista, but she had only waved Alma off.  "It isn't as if anyone could have used it."</p>
            <p>"Hello," Alma said, glaring.  There was a third person too, a much taller man wearing a city-style suit.  To him she said, "Who are you?"</p>
            <p>"The will-reader," he replied.</p>
            <p>"Kalmet is dead," Saumaca explained.</p>
            <p>Alma's mouth thinned. "I know."</p>
            <p>"You...know?" He sounded relieved - had he been afraid to break the news to her?  She eyed him.</p>
            <p>"The sylphs have been piping on about it," Alma admitted, shrugging.  It was generally bad luck to pay attention to sylph elementals, who were notorious gossips and liars.  In stories, those who listened to sylphs became blinded by fantasy and illusion.  They walked off cliffs chasing invisible riches, starved to death sucking their fingers as they imagined eating the finest dishes, or else ended up as empty husks, memories eaten by sylphs and their voracious appetite for information.  It was impossible not to hear sylphs, but safer to ignore them.</p>
            <p> "Ah...right," Saumaca replied, with uncharacteristic dullness.  He looked disheveled - in fact, both he and Bourlev did.  Precious strands of hair fell loose from the rest, floating about unprotected.  Their eyes were dark and pouched beneath.</p>
            <p>"What is that?" Bourlev asked.  He pointed at Alma's hand.</p>
            <p>"It's one of the matriarch's medications," she told him, holding up the string, "which I happened to find lying around on the worktable.  It looks defunct, though" - there was no sparkle to it, no hum - "so I don't think it contaminated anything."</p>
            <p>She expected a sneer from him, or some command to throw whatever was on the worktable away anyway, so it was a surprise when he said, merely: "Oh."</p>
            <p>She glared.  Was he plotting something?  Probably not - Saumaca was the only one of her cousins who was a friend to her, and if he was here, she trusted there wasn't some sort of scheme going on.  So, what was going on?</p>
            <p><em>"Kalmet is dead!"</em></p>
            <p>"So the matriarch is dead," she said.  "I assume that's why the will-reader is here, but isn't it too soon?"</p>
            <p>"It's proper form to read a will as soon as possible," the will-reader informed her. </p>
            <p>"I don't care."</p>
            <p>"Your presence is required for it."</p>
            <p>"Actually," Saumaca said quickly, "everyone's presence is required for it.  Everyone's already heading to the common-hall."</p>
            <p>"Except me," Alma said.  "The matriarch despised me and I am uninterested in learning about the riches that she left for people that she happened to have some margin of affection for."</p>
            <p>"The matriarch loved you," Saumaca argued, "even if she was...different about it.  At the very least, everyone wants to see you."</p>
            <p><em>"He's lying."</em></p>
            <p>Saumaca, lying?  Clearly, but just to be kind.  Wait - Alma shook her head, rubbed her ears.  Ignore them.  Remember the stories, remember people dying horribly.   Only city-dwellers dared to make familiars of elementals, salamanders for their ovens, undines for their sewage - they tasked their chores to forces of nature that could just as easily bake a cake as they could burn down an entire neighborhood.  Alma looked at the will-reader, his impassionate expression.  Did it take an elementalist to do something as meager as reading a will?  If it did, it would explain why no Tonsor clan member was a will-reader.  None of them were stupid enough to actually pay attention to elementals.</p>
            <p>She glanced at Saumaca again.  "Everyone wants to see me?"</p>
            <p> "Everyone," Bourlev echoed with a large nod.</p>
            <p><em>"They're lying."</em></p>
            <p>"It's proper form to read a will with the maker's entire family present," the will-reader said.</p>
            <p>"Family" did seem to be what Alma was to the matriarch, unfortunately.</p>
            <p>"They won't leave without you."</p>
            <p>Alma sighed in frustration, looked down at the table, at her unfinished...what was it supposed to be again?</p>
            <p>"Fine."  She threw the string into a wastebin, brushed her hands on her clothing to remove any lingering spell.  "It better not take long."</p>
            <p>Her stomach grumbled again.  When was the last time she had eaten?  Maybe she could get food before she returned to work.</p>
            <p></p>
            <hr>
            <p></p>
            <p>"How are you today, Saumaca?" Alma asked as they walked.  He smiled at her, belatedly and stiff.</p>
            <p>"I'm alright."</p>
            <p><em>"He's lying."</em></p>
            <p>Alma rubbed her ears again.  Outside the compound, the sylphs were louder, stronger - they whistled more boldly, giggled.  "Listen!  He's lying!"</p>
            <p>So active today.</p>
            <p>"And you, Alma?"</p>
            <p>"I'm well.  A little hungry."</p>
            <p>Saumaca smiled again, slight.  "Me too."</p>
            <p>Though Bourlev and Saumaca were types who would chat to fill up silence, they said nothing more.  Alma stared at Bourlev until she was sure that he was ignoring her gaze.  Well, if he was going to spare her his opinions and speeches today, all the better.</p>
            <p><em>"He's afraid."</em></p>
            <p>Bourlev, the strongest man in Tonsor, afraid?  Why would -</p>
            <p>Ignore it!  Alma started to press herself against Saumaca's side to take comfort from him, but just as she touched him, he jumped.</p>
            <p>"Oh - sorry, Alma - you startled me." He grimaced, and didn't move close to her.  Since when was Saumaca so easily startled?  Since when did he avoid contact with her?</p>
            <p>"What's the matter with you?" she demanded.</p>
            <p>"I...it's just..." Saumaca floundered.</p>
            <p>The will-reader stepped in.  "Maybe if you had been there for the death of the matriarch, you would understand," he said.  "It was a long affair, Alma.  Kalmet required much attention.  She was in great pain and needed many people watching over her.  Saumaca and Bourlev both helped."</p>
            <p>Screaming, thrashing, lashing as the foreign growth in her lungs grated against the soft, oxygenated veins.  Her limbs turning blue, poisoned, falling off one by one.  Her sobs incomprehensible - </p>
            <p>Stop!</p>
            <p>The sylph-painted images scattered from her mind, leaving a wake of snickering.  "<em>Kalmet is dead.</em>"</p>
            <p>They were at the edge of clan territory now, at the common-hall, where it was clear that the rest of the clan was already gathered, slowly filing into the common-hall.  As the four approached, the gathered clan-members turned to them - other weavers, caretakers, even Administrator Proista herself, who said, "Hello, Alma."</p>
            <p>She herself was high-fine white, but to Alma's surprise she noticed the administrator was disheveled too, her hairs floating loose from her veil. Some of her hair even looked crinkled, as if she had been sleeping on it, rather than on a neck pillow to elevate it from the crushing ground.</p>
            <p>"You're looking well." Administrator Proista smiled.  "Come in now, come in."</p>
            <p>The common-hall was already quite crowded.  Alma would have been content at the back, but her group was making their way to the front, and they pushed Alma forward with them.  In the end, she stood with Bourlev and Saumaca near the front of the common-hall, near a table on which a lumpy something was draped with a black cloth.  Kalmet's body?</p>
            <p>She looked to Saumaca, but he wasn't paying attention; he was rubbing his stomach, clearly hungry.</p>
            <p>When everyone settled, the will-reader removed a scroll from his suit.  He waited for Administrator Proista's nod, then unraveled it and cleared his throat.</p>
            <p>"My name is Tonsor Kalmet Enval.  I am the seventieth matriarch of Tonsor, low-medium white." In reading, the will-reader's voice was changing, heightening, becoming quite similar to the voice that had plagued Alma her entire life.  She felt a chill at the back of her neck.  "I have carried this clan for sixty-five years on the sails I made, as no one here has the wits to survive on their own work.  Let my clear opinion be known of the administrators, who I find utterly useless."</p>
            <p>  Alma glanced at Administrator Proista, but if she was offended, she didn't show it.  Her face was blank, tired.</p>
            <p>"Yet they are, after all, the ones who reared me, who gave me food and spells so my hair would grow stronger than any material yielded by machine or chemical.  All I have known in life has been given to me by Tonsor.  And so I in turn, have given it everything: my body, soul, and sanity.</p>
            <p>"In writing this will, then, I must scoff.   I have nothing.  A will left behind after my blessed last breath should concern items I have left behind, none of which I care about.  If you wish, Proista, you may have my faithful, beloved plunger.  You will find it not too far from my toilet.  To Everst, I leave whatever remains of my last bar of soap.  To Mennet, any one of my spoons."</p>
            <p>This was the all-important will-reading?  The will-reader listed more names, more items; administrators, Kalmet's other grandchildren, all were treated with the same contempt. Kalmet loved even less than even Alma expected, but if anyone else was surprised, they didn't show it.</p>
            <p>No.  There was some reaction: increasing nervousness.  Alma heard it in the sound of boards creaking - people shifting their weight from foot to foot - the sound of breaths becoming faster, shorter.  She heard the flap of eyelashes beating like wings as people blinked faster.  Sylphs again, amplifying sounds and relaying them to her ears.</p>
            <p> "Finally," said Kalmet's voice, "there is one last thing I must bestow, the thing that this arcane city-dweller is probably waiting for me to recite.  The item in question is that which I inherited from the patriarch before me...though to be honest, even this is not something I own as much as it owns me."</p>
            <p>Bodies stiffening.  Breaths stopping.  The will-reader's voice growing louder.</p>
            <p>"Tonsor Alma Enval," said Kalmet, her voice now in full clarity from the will-reader's throat, "to you I offer the title of matriarch."</p>
            <p>"What?" Alma said, shocked.  <em>"What?"</em></p>
            <p>There was a muttering - heads turning - Bourlev and Saumaca began to press her towards the front, nearer the will-reader, the black-clothed table.  Everyone was looking at her.</p>
            <p>But not in surprise.</p>
            <p>"They knew."</p>
            <p> "It's not so well-known that the matriarch is less a figurehead than the bearer of our clan's curse," the will-reader said, with a cruel smile.  "Not so well-known one is always sacrificed for the clan's well-being.  As one of Tonsor, we offer of our own bodies to satisfy the res.  But like me, Alma, when you do not have what they want, perfect high-fine white hair, you are useless to them, and they ask not for less, but more.  For your mind, to be given to the learning of sails.  To be given to them."</p>
            <p>At the last word, a wind whipped Alma's hair - she screamed and tried to back away from the stage - but Bourlev and Saumaca were pushing her forward, closer to the will-reader, the black-clothed table.</p>
            <p><em>"Alma, Alma -"</em> They were tugging at her hair, placating, soothing.  <em>"Be calm, Alma.  Kalmet, she was mean, and scary, but she is dead now, don't be scared! We'll do anything you want, Alma, we'll make your hair look the finest of them all, we'll teach you how to make the sails, you'll get so much money, everyone will love you.  Only be our friend!"</em></p>
            <p>No!</p>
            <p>She clawed her ears, tried to flee - but Bourlev had both of her arms now, was holding her in place.  She tried to find Saumaca - met his gaze - sad, quiet.</p>
            <p>"Saumaca!  Help!"</p>
            <p>He was silent, useless.</p>
            <p>The will-reader continued, louder against the wind.  "The sylphs' kindness cannot, of course, be inherited unwillingly." A posthumous grin.  "So I understand if you refuse.  After all, surely by now you know how I met my end - at the claws of the sylphs, at their razor voices.  Oh, they're so sweet at first.  They teach you so eagerly, how to make the sails no city elementalist knows.  They only want your love, as children do.  They beg and demand and force it from you every day and night, every minute and moment...</p>
            <p>"So, this is my will.  For all of you to die - worse than I have died, slow, weak, starving on your last saved provisions.  See if any others come to your monopoly's aid, Proista.  See if they would rather help you or fill your market niche.  See if Alma is kind enough to overlook the fact you have ignored mine and others' abuses to her for years, or if she feels, like me, that all of you are fit to die!"</p>
            <p>The will-reader suddenly staggered, coughed; Kalmet's voice was gone.  He breathed heavily, gripped his throat.  The winds remained, tugging Alma's hair.</p>
            <p>Administrator Proista turned to her.  "Well," she said, quietly.  "Your decision, Alma?"</p>
            <p>A decision between her sanity and the well-being of her clan.  Alma stared in shock.  How could she be expected to make a decision, just like that?  She looked around at the rest of the common-hall, as if anyone could help her; but they only stared back with their dark eyes, their haggard hair ripped away from veils by the wind.  Silent.</p>
            <p>Save for the growls of their stomachs, sylph-amplified to roars.  Everyone was...hungry.</p>
            <p>Starving.</p>
            <p>And then she knew.  She knew what she would do.  She knew what she had done.</p>
            <p>She looked at the table.  The black cloth had been blown off by the wind, revealing a set of pillows arranged on a table.</p>
            <p>"Get off me," Alma snapped, "I'm fine." Bourlev leaped back.</p>
            <p>"Do you remember?" Proista asked eagerly.  And when Alma didn't refuse, she went on: "How talented you are, Alma!  When Kalmet first started, it took her weeks to keep her memory from being eaten by the slyphs - and to think all you need to remind you is the will-reader -"</p>
            <p>Alma started out of the common-hall, tailed by Saumaca and Proista.  She ignored everyone, tried to ignore Proista's babbling, tried to ignore, too, the sylphs' prattling, in which were whiffs of her stolen memory: a litany of her own screams as Kalmet's will, as Alma's inheritance, was read, again and again.</p>
            <p>They returned to the weaver's compound, and Proista patted her back as Alma sat down at the table once more, looked down at the sail she had been trying to finish for the past month.</p>
            <p>Her stomach grumbled again.  She ignored it.</p>
            <p>"Leave me alone," Alma said, and Proista nodded to her, bowed. "Of course, matriarch, of course." She left the room hastily.  Saumaca stayed.</p>
            <p>Again he was silent, only watched as Alma picked up the strands again.  "You might not remember why you...became matriarch," he said finally, hesitant.  "You don't remember, usually.  But you said...you told me to tell you...that you did it willingly.  You did it because you didn't want to be useless anymore."</p>
            <p><em>"He's lying."</em> The sylphs hissed, unsheathed their claws.  They wanted Alma to herself.</p>
            <p>"Get out," she told him sharply, and then turned away, sat down at the table.</p>
            <p>Soon after, she heard the instructions, purred in her ear.</p>
            <p><em>"Beloved Alma.  The next step is here, left over right.  Try it!"</em></p>
            <p>She nodded and continued, stopping only to withdraw a string from her pocket and tie it around her finger.</p>
